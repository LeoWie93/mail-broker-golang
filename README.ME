# Email Broker

## TODO
- [ ] require client secret with middleware handling
- [ ] add go cli tool to view, add and delete client secret pairs => maybe use gum? https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum 
- [ ] write my own env parser

## SMTP


## API
The idea is using the mailtrap api. But this is only possible if one has already a accepted domain to send mails.
Maybe try verfying it again to implement the api
